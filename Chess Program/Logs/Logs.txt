Potential Ideas:
Using a highlighting method to determine if a move is valid or not
if(button pressed is highlighted)
    swap positions


not gonna lie the move method is hard as hell

move()

make sure the king is not checked
check conditions - can't expose the king to a check,
                        make sure the line of path is clear(except the knight), castle and en passants
the actual moving part - if button is pressed with a certain piece on it, show possible moves by changing the color
                         of the available locations(red if capture),make sure it does not go out of board and cant take own piece,
                         if it goes to an empty location, put class there and get rid of class in the previous square, move picture
after moving - check to see if the opponent king is checked, enable the other pieces to move, disable black pieces from moving
